Description: Secure Reliable Transport UDP streaming library (OpenSSL flavour)
 SRT is a latency-aware UDP transport mechanism optimized for video streams.
 It detects and compensates for jitter and bandwidth fluctuations due to
 network congestion. It mitigates packet loss and supports AES encryption.
 .
 SSL support is provided by OpenSSL.
